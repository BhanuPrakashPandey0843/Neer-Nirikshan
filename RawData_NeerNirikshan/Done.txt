# 📌 1. Objective of the Project

The objecti00000000ve of this research is to perform a **
Performance Comparison of Machine Learning
Approaches for Groundwater Quality Assessment
** using official monitoring data collected between 2019 and 2023.

The study aims to:

* Combine multi-year groundwater datasets
* Create a structured master database
* Prepare data for Water Quality Index (WQI), statistical, and machine learning analysis
* Enable contamination trend analysis across states and districts

---

# 📌 2. Data Source

All groundwater quality data has been collected from:

Central Ground Water Board

Specifically, the following annual datasets were downloaded:

* Ground Water Quality Data – 2019
* Ground Water Quality Data – 2020
* Ground Water Quality Data – 2021
* Ground Water Quality Data – 2022
* Ground Water Quality Data – 2023

These datasets contain:

* Well ID
* State
* District
* Block
* Village
* Latitude & Longitude
* Physico-chemical parameters:

  * pH
  * EC (µS/cm)
  * CO3
  * HCO3
  * Cl
  * SO4
  * NO3
  * PO4
  * Total Hardness (TH)
  * Ca, Mg, Na, K
  * Fluoride (F)
  * TDS
  * SiO2

# 📌 3. Folder Structure Created

A structured project directory was created:

```
NeerNirikshan/
│
├── RawData/
│   ├── final_nhs-wq_pre_2019_compressed.pdf
│   ├── final_nhs-wq_pre_2020_compressed.pdf
│   ├── final_nhs-wq_pre_2021_compressed.pdf
│   ├── final_nhs-wq_pre_2022_compressed.pdf
│   ├── final_nhs-wq_pre_2023_compressed.pdf
│
├── ProcessedData/
│
├── Scripts/
│   └── extract_and_combine.py
│
└── venv/   (Python virtual environment)
```

This ensures:

* Reproducibility
* Clean workflow
* Research-grade organization

---

# 📌 4. Python Environment Setup

A dedicated Python virtual environment was created to ensure dependency isolation.

Installed libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* tabula-py
* jpype1
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* openpyxl

Java was verified to support PDF table extraction using Tabula.

---

# 📌 5. Data Extraction Process

A Python script (`extract_and_combine.py`) was developed to:

1. Read all PDF files using `tabula`
2. Extract all tables from each PDF
3. Remove repeated header rows
4. Add a Year column (extracted from filename)
5. Concatenate all years into one dataset
6. Export the combined dataset as:

```
CGWB_2019_2023_RAW_COMBINED.csv
```

This creates a unified multi-year groundwater quality dataset.

---

# 📌 6. Current Status

✔ All PDFs downloaded
✔ Folder structure created
✔ Virtual environment configured
✔ Extraction script written
✔ JPype dependency issue identified and resolved
✔ Ready to generate combined raw dataset

---

# 📌 7. Next Steps

The upcoming phases include:

### Phase 1 – Data Cleaning

* Remove malformed rows
* Standardize column names
* Convert numeric columns
* Handle missing values
* Remove repeated header artifacts

### Phase 2 – Data Validation

* Check column consistency across years
* Verify units
* Remove duplicate entries

### Phase 3 – Analytical Preparation

* Compute Water Quality Index (WQI)
* Perform trend analysis (2019–2023)
* Conduct state-wise contamination comparison
* Prepare dataset for ML models

---

# 📌 8. Research Direction

The dataset will support:

* Spatio-temporal groundwater assessment
* Contamination exceedance analysis
* Machine learning-based classification
* Risk zoning and mapping

---

# 🎯 Summary Statement

At this stage, the project has successfully completed:

> Data acquisition, environment setup, and automated extraction pipeline development.

The project is now entering the **data cleaning and preprocessing phase**, which is critical before performing statistical and machine learning analysis.
